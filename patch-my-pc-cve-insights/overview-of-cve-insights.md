# Overview of CVE Insights

_Applies to: Patch My PC CVE Insights_

Patch My PC’s (PMPC’s) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) product, _CVE Insights_, can help security, IT professionals, and end/home users easily stay up-to-date with CVEs that could affect their environments.

Users can receive automatic notifications of all CVEs and configure personalized alerts.

A very common issue in many organizations is that the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the Security team receive a lot of information from different sources, some of which is irrelevant.

Once they’ve worked out what is relevant, determining what actually needs to be done to address the CVE can be confusing, plus they don’t have an easy way of checking if an applicable patch is available for a CVE and whether that patch has been deployed to their environment.

Given that the CISO ultimately owns the risk, they need as much help as they can get. This is where our free CVE Insights mobile app can help as it provides executive-first friendly news snippets to help CISOs and their organizations figure out which vulnerabilities affect their environment.

If you are a PMPC Cloud customer, you can optionally sign in to your PMPC Cloud Company from CVE Insights and easily view the patching status of all of your deployments that are affected by the CVEs you are tracking.
