# CVE Insights "Analytics" tab

_Applies to: Patch My PC CVE Insights_

The <strong>Analytics</strong> tab of Patch My PC’s (PMPC’s) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) product, _CVE Insights_, allows you to view analytic data for CVEs.

The <strong>Analytics</strong> page contains two tabs:

* <strong>General –</strong> Contains information about all CVEs.
* <strong>Personal –</strong> Contains information only about CVEs you’ve created [Alerts](cve-insights-alerts-tab.md) for.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>If you have a subscription that includes PMPC Cloud and have [signed in to your PMPC Cloud Company](cve-insights-settings-tab.md#sign-in-to-your-pmpc-cloud-company-from-cve-insights) from CVE Insights, then the <strong>Company</strong> tab will appear, showing only those CVEs affecting your company, based on your current Intune app discovery data.</p>
</blockquote>

By default, the <strong>Analytics</strong> page shows the total number of CVEs created and updated in the past day. These are then broken down by CVE score, showing the percentage of total CVEs for the time period, and finally the total number of CVEs for that CVE rating.

At the bottom of the legend, you’ll see the total number of CVEs and their average score.

Scrolling further down, the <strong>Vendors</strong> section contains a list of the top five vendors, showing the number of CVEs and CVE score.

If there is a plus (<strong>+</strong>) beside a vendor, clicking it will expand the vendor to show the individual products and their related CVE information.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>If shown, click <strong>View More</strong> to see the next five vendors, repeating where relevant.</p>
</blockquote>

Next, the <strong>Related News</strong> section will show you any related news stories, the date of those news items, and whether there are any patches available.

To select a different time period, click on the dropdown and select the desired time period to see the updated analytics.

Clicking a vendor opens the <strong>Vendor Analytics</strong> page, which shows a rating (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, or <strong>C</strong>) for the vendor.

Lower down is a heat map with a legend showing a breakdown of the CVEs for that vendor for the selected period.

The more CVEs a vendor has, the bigger the circle, the higher it is on the graph, and the hotter the color.

Scrolling down this page, you can view data for all of the <strong>Products</strong> affected by CVEs for the selected vendor.

Scrolling further down the page, you will see a list of the <strong>Latest Vulnerabilities</strong>, including ratings for this vendor. Clicking on a CVE will open it in the <strong>CVE Details</strong> page, where you can see more information.

You can also click an individual product to open the <strong>Product Analytics</strong> page, which contains similar information to the <strong>Vendor Analytics</strong> page.
