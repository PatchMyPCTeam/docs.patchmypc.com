# Managing CVE Insights Notifications

_Applies to: Patch My PC CVE Insights_

The **Notifications** feature is available across all tabs and is used to tell you when you have a notification related to any Alerts you have configured.

You will see a green dot with the number of new notifications each time you get a notification.

Clicking the Notification icon opens the **Notifications** screen, showing you a list of all the notifications you have received, both read and unread, sorted by the most recent first.

Notifications are grouped by day, with any new/unread Notifications being shown with a green dot beside the time they were received.

Click a notification to expand it (which clears the green dot).

From here, you can click:

* **Mark All As Read** to clear the new notification indicator for all notifications.
* **Delete All** to delete all of your notifications
* A specific notification to see more details.

**Note**

If you don’t have network connectivity when a notification is sent, you won’t miss it. The next time you use the CVE Insights app or network connectivity is resumed, you will receive any new/missed notifications.
{% endhint %}

You can swipe left on a notification and select **Delete** to delete it.
