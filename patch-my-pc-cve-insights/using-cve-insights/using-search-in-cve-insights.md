# Using Search in CVE Insights

_Applies to: Patch My PC CVE Insights_

The **Search** feature is available across all tabs and can be used to search for specific CVEs, vendors, or products, based on the News feed.

As well as searching, you can also use this feature to:

* [Sort search results](using-search-in-cve-insights.md#sort-search-results)
* [Clear a Search](using-search-in-cve-insights.md#clear-a-search)
* [Filter Results](using-search-in-cve-insights.md#filter-results)

To use the Search feature:

1. Click the magnifying glass in the header.
2. On the **CVE Search**, enter your search in the search field (for example, the CVE ID, product and vendor) and click the magnifying glass.\
   \
   Any matching CVEs are displayed.\
   \
   If a patch is available for a CVE, you will see **Patches Available** at the bottom of a search result, along with the number of patches.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>**Note**</p>
<p>Clicking **Patches Available** opens the **CVE Details** page and if you scroll down to the **Patches** section, it will show you whether the patch is currently deployed or not.</p>
<p>You will see **Patches Available** in the search results regardless of whether or not you are signed into your PMPC Company. However, if you want to see the details of any deployments related to the patches, you will need to sign into your PMPC Cloud company.</p>
<p>See [Sign in to your PMPC Cloud Company from CVE Insights](cve-insights-settings-tab.md#sign-in-to-your-pmpc-cloud-company-from-cve-insights) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>

Clicking any of the results will open the **CVE Details** page for that CVE.

### Sort search results

Once youâ€™ve completed a search, you can click the sort button, which opens the **Sort by** dialog, which allows you to control how you want to sort your search results (for example, by the date it was published, updated, score, ascending or descending, etc.).

Click **Apply** to return to your search results, re-sorted by the chosen option.

### Clear a Search

To clear a search, click the red **x** in the search box.

### Filter Results

You can also filter the items you see on the **CVE Search** page by clicking the filter button in the top right-hand corner.

On the **Filter** page, complete the required fields and click **Apply**.

The results on the **CVE Search** page update to show only the results matching your filters.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>**Tip**</p>
<p>If the filter button has a little green dot beside it, filters have been applied and are active.</p>
</blockquote>

To clear filters, click the filter button in the top right-hand corner.

On the **Filter** page, click **Clear All**

The results on the **CVE Search** page update to show only the unfiltered results and the green dot beside the filter button disappears.
