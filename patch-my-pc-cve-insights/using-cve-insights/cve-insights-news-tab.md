# CVE Insights "News" tab

_Applies to: Patch My PC CVE Insights_

The **News** tab of Patch My PC’s (PMPC’s) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) product, _CVE Insights_, shows a curated news feed of CVEs written by our security professionals.

It consists of the following two tabs:

* **All -** which lists of all CVEs and is selected by default.
* **Personal –** which only shows you the CVEs you have created [Alerts](cve-insights-alerts-tab.md) for.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-note">
<p>If you have a subscription that includes PMPC Cloud and have [signed in to your PMPC Cloud Company](cve-insights-settings-tab.md#sign-in-to-your-pmpc-cloud-company-from-cve-insights) from CVE Insights, then the **Company** tab will appear, showing only those CVEs affecting your company, based on discovery data from your Intune environment.</p>
</blockquote>

For each CVE, in the Newsfeed, we show:

* The name of the CVE
* A brief summary
* The **CVSS Max Score** (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), where 10 is highest, 0 is lowest.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-note">
<p>The **Max Score** refers to the fact that a given news item could refer to multiple CVEs and represents the maximum or worst CVSS score across the CVEs referenced.</p>
<p>See the **Qualitative Severity Ratings** section of <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss">Vulnerability Metrics</a> for more information.</p>
</blockquote>

* Whether PMPC patches are available
* The date the CVE was released.
