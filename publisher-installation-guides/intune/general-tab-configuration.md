# License Key

_Applies to: On-premises Publisher_

### Catalog Information - License Key

When the publisher first launches, you will be required to provide a license key. If you have not yet purchased and received your license key, we provide two additional <strong>free options for testing our product</strong>.

The first option is to enable the [<strong>Limited Trial Mode</strong>.](https://patchmypc.com/frequently-asked-questions#trial-catalog) This limited trial mode does have some restrictions including a limited number of products as covered in the link above. We encourage you to [<strong>request a free thirty-day trial</strong>](https://patchmypc.com/free-trial) from our website. When you receive your full-trial or customer license email, it will contain your 20 character license key.
