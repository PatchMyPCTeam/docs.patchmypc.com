# Intune Apps

_Applies to: On-premises Publisher_

## Feature Enablement&#x20;

To enable products to publish, check the "**Enable creation of Win32 applications in Microsoft Intune**" checkbox.

Once the option is selected, you'll be able to enable other products. When first getting started with the product, it is recommended that you only **choose one or two products** to reduce the impact on the first sync and to validate your implementation quickly. We have found that **Notepad++** and **7-Zip** tend to be great initial use case tests.

<p>**Tip**: We recommend enabling **Manage Conflicting Processes** for **Notepad++**</p>

To find and enable these products, you can search the list of products using **Ctrl + F** or by clicking on the magnifying glass in the lower right corner.&#x20;

When you select the search button a dialogue will open, type in one of our example products and hit enter, or click OK.

<p>If you hit **OK**  instead of **Apply**, don't worry as the Publisher will close after saving the changes. You can just re-open and keep right on working.</p>
