# Intune Apps

_Applies to: On-premises Publisher_

## Feature Enablement&#x20;

To enable products to publish, check the "**Enable creation of Win32 applications in Microsoft Intune**" checkbox.

Once the option is selected, you'll be able to enable other products. When first getting started with the product, it is recommended that you only **choose one or two products** to reduce the impact on the first sync and to validate your implementation quickly. We have found that **Notepad++** and **7-Zip** tend to be great initial use case tests.

**Tip**: We recommend enabling **Manage Conflicting Processes** for **Notepad++**

To find and enable these products, you can search the list of products using **Ctrl + F** or by clicking on the magnifying glass in the lower right corner.&#x20;

When you select the search button a dialogue will open, type in one of our example products and hit enter, or click OK.

Once you have found the product you want to patch, click the checkbox for your architecture choice and click **Apply**.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip**: You can right-click All Products, Vendors, or individual Products to apply custom installation options as described in the article below.

If you hit **OK**  instead of **Apply**, don't worry as the Publisher will close after saving the changes. You can just re-open and keep right on working.
