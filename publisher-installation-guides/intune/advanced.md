# Advanced

_Applies to: On-premises Publisher_

## Local Content Repository

Certain [products](https://patchmypc.com/local-content-repository-for-licensed-applications-that-require-manual-download) require the content to be downloaded ahead of time into a known folder. This typically is related to specific vendors who's content can only be downloaded after logging in or paying for the software. &#x20;

## Backup and Restore

All settings within the publisher are backed up. These settings are stored in the backup directory where the Publisher is installed. You can get an immediate backup of the publisher at any time using the options in the Advanced tab. The publisher is closed using the "OK" button, or the "Apply" Button.
