### Disable Microsoft Intune Standalone Mode

Ensure the option **Enable Microsoft Intune standalone mode** is **not selected**. Enabling this will disable any prerequisite checks for integration with WSUS/ConfigMgr and also hide options for publishing to WSUS/ConfigMgr after installation.

This option is for customers who intend to publish only to Microsoft Intune.&#x20;

Click **Next**.
