  Let's get started by enabling a couple of updates to verify we can publish to
  WSUS.

# Updates (On-premises Publisher)

_Applies to: On-premises Publisher_

## Feature Enablement&#x20;

To enable products to publish, check the <strong>Enable publishing of third-party updates</strong> checkbox.

Once the option is selected, you'll be able to enable other products.&#x20;

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: When first getting started with the product, it is recommended that you only <strong>choose one or two products</strong> to reduce the time of the first sync and to validate your implementation quickly. We have found that <strong>Notepad++</strong> and <strong>7-Zip</strong> tend to be great initial use case tests.</p>
</blockquote>

To find and enable these products, you can search the list of updates using <strong>Ctrl + F</strong> or by clicking on the magnifying glass in the lower right corner.&#x20;

When you select the search button a dialogue will open, type in one of our example products and hit enter, or click <strong>OK</strong>.

<p>If you happen to hit <strong>OK</strong>  instead of <strong>Apply</strong>, don't worry the publisher will close after saving the changes. You can just re-open and keep right on working.</p>
