# Sync Schedule

_Applies to: On-premises Publisher_

## Scheduling Daily Publish

By default, we recommend the Publisher sync runs on a daily basis. The sync schedule only controls <strong>when updates or applications are published</strong> to your environment. Patch My PC does <strong>not automatically create deployments</strong> in Configuration Manager for you.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Generally, Patch My PC releases an update to the catalog <strong>three to five times a week</strong>. These updates are released usually posted by <strong>4:00 PM Eastern Time</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

When Patch My PC releases these new updates, the <strong>sync schedule is what automates the publication process</strong>. You can also manually start the sync and publication process at any time by selecting the <strong>Run Publishing Service Sync</strong> option.
