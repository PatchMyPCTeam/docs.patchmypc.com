# Sync Schedule

_Applies to: On-premises Publisher_

## Scheduling Daily Publish

By default, we recommend the Publisher sync runs on a daily basis. The sync schedule only controls **when updates or applications are published** to your environment. Patch My PC does **not automatically create deployments** in Configuration Manager for you.

> **Tip**: Generally, Patch My PC releases an update to the catalog **three to five times a week**. These updates are released usually posted by **4:00 PM Eastern Time**.

When Patch My PC releases these new updates, the **sync schedule is what automates the publication process**. You can also manually start the sync and publication process at any time by selecting the **Run Publishing Service Sync** option.
