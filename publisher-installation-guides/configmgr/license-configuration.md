# License Key

_Applies to: On-premises Publisher_

### Catalog Information - License Key

When the publisher first launches, you will be required to provide a license key. If you have not yet purchased and received your license key, we provide two additional **free options for testing our product**.

The first option is to enable the [**Limited Trial Mode**.](https://patchmypc.com/frequently-asked-questions#trial-catalog) This limited trial mode does have some restrictions including a limited number of products as covered in the link above. We encourage you to [**request a free thirty-day trial**](https://patchmypc.com/free-trial) from our website. When you receive your full-trial or customer license email, it will contain your 20 character license key.

The [**full-access 30-day trial**](https://patchmypc.com/free-trial) contains all features and access to all products.
{% endhint %}

If the license validation is successful, it should look like the below image.

If you receive an error when clicking Validate URL, please review our knowledge base article [Troubleshooting License Activation Issues](https://patchmypc.com/troubleshooting-license-activation-issues). License activation errors are often related to firewall or proxy configurations.
