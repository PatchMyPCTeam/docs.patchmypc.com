***

> \*\*Note\*\*
>
> The Advanced Insights Inventory Extensions will add approximately 0.5 MB per-client to the Configuration Manager database. We recommend increasing the acceptable inventory file size from the default of 5MB to a minimum of 10MB.
>
> To do so, edit the below registry value on the ConfigMgr site server:
>
> \* \*\*Registry key:\*\* HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS\\\_INVENTORY\\\_DATA\\\_LOADER
>
> \* \*\*Registry value:\*\* Max MIF Size
>
> \* \*\*Data:\*\* 10485760 (decimal) / a00000 (hexadecimal)
