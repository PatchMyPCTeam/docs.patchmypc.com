## ðŸ’¿ Deploy the Inventory Extensions MSI to clients

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you have previously deployed the "**PMPC Data Collection**" PowerShell Package, please ensure you delete its deployment before deploying the new **InventoryExtensions.msi**
{% endhint %}

![](../../_images/image%20%281325%29.png%20"ConfigMgr%20package%20\"PMPC%20Data%20Collection%20%28LEGACY)\" to remove")

{% hint style="info" %}
After removing the deployment for the legacy PMPC Data Collection package, the **InventoryExtensions.msi** must be installed on clients you wish to collect inventory data from.
{% endhint %}

### Client-Side Requirements for the Inventory Extensions MSI

* Windows 10/11, Windows Server 2012 - 2022 (64-bit)
* .NET Framework 4.8

You can deploy the **Inventory Extensions** product via <mark style="color:green;">**Patch My PC Publishing Service**</mark>

1\. Open the Patch My PC Publisher, navigate to the ConfigMgr/Intune Apps tab and select **Patch My PC >** **Advanced Insights Inventory Extensions (MSI-x64)**

![](../../_images/image%20%281321%29.png%20"Advanced%20Insights%20Inventory%20Extensions%20app%20in%20the%20PMPC%20Publisher")

2\.

(Selective sync).**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

We also recommend that you enable the Advanced Insights Inventory Extensions (MSI-x64) WSUS/Intune **UPDATE** to ensure your clients receive newer versions of the Inventory Extensions as they are released.
{% endhint %}

***

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

The Advanced Insights Inventory Extensions will add approximately 0.5 MB per-client to the Configuration Manager database. We recommend increasing the acceptable inventory file size from the default of 5MB to a minimum of 10MB.&#x20;

To do so, edit the below registry value on the ConfigMgr site server:

* **Registry key:** HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS\_INVENTORY\_DATA\_LOADER
* **Registry value:** Max MIF Size&#x20;
* **Data:** 10485760 (decimal) / a00000 (hexadecimal)&#x20;
{% endhint %}
