# Advanced Insights Inventory Extensions

_Applies to: Patch My PC Advanced and Patch Insights_

Several features of Advanced Insights (this is not relevant for Patch Insights) require the deployment of our Inventory Extensions. This process adds additional reports and functionality to Configuration Manager.

To setup the Inventory Extensions, there are **two** actions to complete:

***

* Windows 10/11, Windows Server 2012 - 2022 (64-bit)
* .NET Framework 4.8

> \*\*Note\*\*
>
> We also recommend that you enable the Advanced Insights Inventory Extensions (MSI-x64) WSUS/Intune \*\*UPDATE\*\* to ensure your clients receive newer versions of the Inventory Extensions as they are released.

***

> \*\*Note\*\*
>
> The Advanced Insights Inventory Extensions will add approximately 0.5 MB per-client to the Configuration Manager database. We recommend increasing the acceptable inventory file size from the default of 5MB to a minimum of 10MB.
>
> To do so, edit the below registry value on the ConfigMgr site server:
>
> \* \*\*Registry key:\*\* HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS\\\_INVENTORY\\\_DATA\\\_LOADER
>
> \* \*\*Registry value:\*\* Max MIF Size
>
> \* \*\*Data:\*\* 10485760 (decimal) / a00000 (hexadecimal)
