<p>The Advanced Insights Inventory Extensions will add approximately 0.5 MB per-client to the Configuration Manager database. We recommend increasing the acceptable inventory file size from the default of 5MB to a minimum of 10MB.&#x20;</p>
<p>To do so, edit the below registry value on the ConfigMgr site server:</p>
<p>* **Registry key:** HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS\_INVENTORY\_DATA\_LOADER</p>
<p>* **Registry value:** Max MIF Size&#x20;</p>
<p>* **Data:** 10485760 (decimal) / a00000 (hexadecimal)&#x20;</p>
