<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>The Advanced Insights Inventory Extensions will add approximately 0.5 MB per-client to the Configuration Manager database. We recommend increasing the acceptable inventory file size from the default of 5MB to a minimum of 10MB.&#x20;</p>
<p>To do so, edit the below registry value on the ConfigMgr site server:</p>
<p>* <strong>Registry key:</strong> HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS\_INVENTORY\_DATA\_LOADER</p>
<p>* <strong>Registry value:</strong> Max MIF Size&#x20;</p>
<p>* <strong>Data:</strong> 10485760 (decimal) / a00000 (hexadecimal)&#x20;</p>
