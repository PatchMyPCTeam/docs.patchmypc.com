# Advanced Insights and Microsoft Updates Inventory

_Applies to: Patch My PC Advanced Insights_

If you use **Intune** to manage your windows updates (**Windows Update for Business**) then none of that compliance data is visible from ConfigMgr. This requires you to have to read compliance data from BOTH ConfigMgr and Intune.

## Solution

* You get **complete** visibility of **all** update compliance from Advanced Insights

**\***

**How does it work?**

**We supplement your ConfigMgr compliance data with** additional data **from Microsoft Update.**

**Our Inventory Extensions WMI Provider runs on clients and scans against Microsoft Update to find update compliance data. This data is then pulled into ConfigMgr via Hardware Inventory for reporting.**

\*

## Requirements

1. You must complete the implementation steps in the [Configuration Guide](advanced-insights-inventory-extensions/)
2. Clients must be configured to use **Windows Update for Business**
