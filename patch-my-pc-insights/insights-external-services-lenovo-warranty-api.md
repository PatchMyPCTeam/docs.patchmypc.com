Advanced Insights (this is not relevant for Patch Insights)  will display the warranty status of Lenovo devices in the device modal display. We need to provide a warranty API token to be able to get this data.

To apply for a warranty API token you need to request one from your Lenovo account manager.

Once you have successfully obtained your API key log into Advanced Insights and navigate to the Administration area. Go to Settings - External Services and check the "Is Enabled" and "Enable Warranty Caching" option.

Enter the provided Lenovo warranty text for the Lenovo API Client token and click save all.

You can then navigate to the Warranty dashboard and click the Bulk Processing object in the top left to initiate warranty lookup.
