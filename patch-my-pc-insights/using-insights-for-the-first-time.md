The welcome screen needs your Patch My PC license key and your ConfigMgr site server details.

### License Key

If Advanced Insights is installed on the same server as the Patch My PC Publisher we will read the license key automatically. Alternatively, please add your license key and click to verify.&#x20;

### Configuration Manager Database Details

Provide the server name and database name of your ConfigMgr primary site and click to connect.

As long as the IIS application pool identity running the Advanced Insights Controller website has permission to read the database, you should be good to go.&#x20;

If you have a problem at this stage, please see [this document ](insights-sql-permission-requirements.md)for details on granting SQL permissions.
