## Creating your first Custom Dashboard

Custom Dashboards are created and maintained in the Administration node.&#x20;

Click Create New to open the dashboard editor.

Here I have provide a name, description and chosen an icon for my dashboard. I have filtered the "page" column of the dashboard items column to find the objects I want.&#x20;

Each item I add to my custom dashboard can have dedicated filter options applied. Here I have selected the update I wish to see the trend data for and have set that I want to render data from the date posted. I will add a second Update Installation Trend chart top my dashboard and set it to show the state of a different update.

Having saved my dashboard, it now shows up in the menu and I can select it to render my chosen charts.
