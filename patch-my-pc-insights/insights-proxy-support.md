# Insights Proxy Support

_Applies to: Patch My PC Advanced and Patch Insights_

Advanced Insights supports http, socks4 and socks5 network proxies.&#x20;

Please add the correct protocol to the start of your proxies' network address e.g. http://x.x.x.x, socks4://x.x.x.x, socks5://x.x.x.x. \
Ports can be added at the end of the network address e.g. http://x.x.x.x:1234"

### Adding a proxy server in the Welcome page

If Advanced Insights cannot automatically access our licensing service at https://api.patchmypc.com we will automatically prompt for you to supply proxy details.
