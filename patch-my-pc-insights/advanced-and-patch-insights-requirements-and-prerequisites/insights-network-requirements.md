# Insights  Network Requirements

_Applies to: Patch My PC Advanced and Patch Insights_

### Network Ports <a href="#network-ports" id="network-ports"></a>

Advanced Insights use the following ports, and the installer will automatically create Windows firewall exceptions for these ports.

* Advanced Insights Frontend - **tcp/443** (or whatever you have customised this to in the installer)
* Advanced Insights API - **tcp/44301** (cannot be changed)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Both ports (443/custom frontend port and 44301) need to allowed through your firewall or network filtering software for internal network access to the application. If you want Advanced Insights to be accessed by multiple remote devices, please follow the appropriate procedure to unblock these two ports on your network.

You will more than likely see either no login screen, or an error message stating "Unable to Connect to the API Server" if either of these ports are blocked. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

* Firewall must allow RPC Traffic to your ConfigMgr Provider (TCP ports: **135**, **RPC dynamic ports (49152â€“65535)**
