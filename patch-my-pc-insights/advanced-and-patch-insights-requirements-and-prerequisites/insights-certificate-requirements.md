# Insights Certificate Requirements

_Applies to: Patch My PC Advanced and Patch Insights_

Advanced Insights needs a valid SSL certificate to install and function. <strong>(the installer will verify the certificate is valid).</strong>

Supported Certificate types:

* Server host (FQDN) standard certificate.
* Wildcard certificate.
* Custom CNAME / Alias certificate.
* Self-signed certificate.

The certificate must meet the following minimum requirements:

* Support HTTPS / SSL.
* Has private key.
* Valid in-date (not expired).
* Enhanced key usage includes "Server Authentication".
* Only modern signature types are supported (e.g. SHA256). Legacy / weak signature algorithms, for example; 'SHA1', 'MD2', 'MD4', 'MD5 are not supported.
* Subject Alternative Name (SAN). The certificate SAN requirements depend on the chosen deployment configuration for the Advanced Insights URL.
  * <strong>Scenario 1 - Server Host name certificate.</strong>
    * For Advanced Insights URL deployment using <strong>server host name</strong> (e.g. _https://server01.contoso.local_) the certificate SAN must contain an entry which matches the FQDN of the host server where Advanced Insights is installed.
  * <strong>Scenario 2 - Wildcard certificate.</strong>
    * For Advanced Insights URL deployment using a <strong>wildcard certificate</strong>, an entry must be included in the certificate SAN that represents the wildcard certificate. e.g. ' _\*contoso.local_'.
  * <strong>Scenario 3 - CNAME / Alias certificate.</strong>
    * For Advanced Insights URL deployment using a <strong>CNAME / Alias,</strong> (e.g. _https://AdvancedInsights.contoso.local_) the certificate SAN must contain an entry which represents the CNAME / Alias. e.g. '_AdvancedInsights.contoso.local'._

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When using a <strong>CNAME / Alias</strong> or <strong>Wilcard</strong> certificate for custom Advanced Insights deployment URL, ensure that DNS has been updated to include an entry which represents the chosen CNAME / Alias.</p>

Certificate SAN values can be also verified within the certificate properties.

![](/_images/image-(1027).png "Wildcard Host Certificate - Subject Alternative Name (SAN) properties.")

<p>On the Windows Server OS which will host Advanced Insights, the following PowerShell script can be executed to list supported certificates.</p>

<p><strong>Self-signed certificate use.</strong></p>
<p>When deploying Advanced Insights using a self-signed certificate, the installer will automatically create the certificate using the server host name value to create the Advanced Insights URL.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>_https://server01.contoso.local_</p>
<p>We don't recommend using a self-signed certificate long-term in production as it won't be trusted by other client browsers by default.\</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>You can replace a self-signed certificate or modify the certificate in use using the Add/Remove Programs "Change" option as detailed [here](../modify-insights/modify-insights-ssl-certificate.md).</p>
