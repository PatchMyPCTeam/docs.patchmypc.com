This dashboard shows details for device properties from within Configuration Manager.

The top row of statistics gives you quick access to Managed Devices (Devices with a Configuration Manager client), Virtual Devices, Portable Devices and Desktop Devices.

Click through any of these dash stats to be able to load a table with all the information.

From this table you are able to do several different functions.  You have the ability to multi select devices and perform one of the many built-in right click options available to you in the Configuration Manager Console and also some of the PatchMyPC actions too.

There is an export button at the top right corner (Cog) where you can export the dataset to a CSV file.
