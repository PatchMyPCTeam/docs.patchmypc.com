Each collection is shown, with its relevant metadata and device count. The Quick Search feature helps to rapidly location a specific Collection, the containing console folder is shown in the Path column.&#x20;

Clicking an individual collection opens the Collection Members view:

This view allows you to remove members with the delete button (for direct members only). You can also access all of the client actions available for one or more selected clients using the Bulk Actions menu.

The list icon hosts an Add Resources option. Clicking this allows you to import a CSV of resources to add to the selected collection.&#x20;

The collection modification process will verify that the listed devices are valid clients, and are not already members, before adding to the collection, the results of the action will be shown on completion.
