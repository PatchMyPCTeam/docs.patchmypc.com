On this operating system dashboard we are showing the following information:

* Pending Restarts - all devices
* Pending Restarts - Windows Updates
* Server
* Workstations
* Client Computer Operating Systems
* Windows OS Servicing

When you select Pending Restarts for one of the 4 options at the top you get a table with the device information, but also you get to see what the client has reported it is pending a restart for.

In this donut chart you can pivot the information using the properties button to show either the following information:

* Support Status
* Servicing Channel
* Release Version
* Edition (SKU)
* Build Version

From selecting a property you can then go and select for example build version and get a report just on one particular build version.

Or by clicking on the cog and then selecting View all Chart data you can get a table with all the devices in that property selected.\
