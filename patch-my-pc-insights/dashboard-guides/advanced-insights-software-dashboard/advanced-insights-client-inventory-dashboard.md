The Client Inventory dashboard provides you with high-performance access to Configuration Manager's software inventory data.&#x20;

The statistics across the top list the counts of applications installed in the user profiles across your estate and how many devices have applications installed in this way. Plus a count of 32 and 64-bit applications.

The table lists all apps in a quickly searchable and filterable way. Each discovered application is listed by Publisher and Display name. Where multiple versions of an application are present in the environment a count of versions is shown.
