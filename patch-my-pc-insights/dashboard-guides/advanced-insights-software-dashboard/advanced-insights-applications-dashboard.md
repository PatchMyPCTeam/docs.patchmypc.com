This dashboard shows details for all Applications defined in the Configuration Manager console.&#x20;

The top row of statistics give you quick access to any applications modified recently as well as enabling you to see unused applications which can potentially be retired.

The table lists all applications and their aggregated deployment status, i.e. if there are multiple deployments for an application this level provides an overall summary of all deployments. This table can be filtered to a chosen collection.

Click through to any individual application shows additional detail, including individual deployment compliance:
