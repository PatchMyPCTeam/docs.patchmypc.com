# Advanced Insights Active Directory Group to Role Assignment

_Applies to: Patch My PC Advanced Insights_

Active Directory Group Authentication enables the Advanced Insights administrator to associate Advanced Insights Roles with AD Security Groups. This ensures that a new user is automatically granted the relevant rights in the portal without the need for manual user creation.

To use this feature, first enable Active Directory Authentication using Administration - Settings - User Management, more details [here](https://docs.patchmypc.com/installation-guides/advanced-insights/active-directory-integration).

Once this is configured, we can assign an existing role to an Active Directory Group, or create a new role for a group. **N.B. There is currently no support for nested groups.**

**Assigning a Role to an Active Directory Group**

Navigate to **Administration** > **Roles**.

1. Click Create new role
2. Enter a name for the role (in this example, "Helpdesk"
3. Type the name of the associated Active Directory Security Group, here, we are using "sg-Helpdesk". Ensure the group name is validated on save.
