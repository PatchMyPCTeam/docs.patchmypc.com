The way each of the nodes in the <strong>Reporting</strong> feature works is the same.

Data is summarized into several key areas known as _Statistics_, which show headline numbers, and donut charts, which show a summary of data broken down by key values.

Hovering your mouse over a segment of a donut chart shows you information for that segment, including the number of records within it.

Clicking either a statistic or a segment of a donut chart displays a table showing the individual records.

From this ClickThrough, you can:

* Search for a specific record within the table
* Sort a column
* Click an individual record to display more information about it.

Using the Device ClickThrough for an individual device allows you to view more information about the device. We also have more detailed views for Software Updates.

Like other areas of the Portal, you can:

* Click through pages by clicking the relevant arrow.
* Set the <strong>Items per page</strong> to your liking.

### Refreshing the Data

By default, Intune data is refreshed on average once day. To refresh your data, click <strong>Refresh Data</strong>.
