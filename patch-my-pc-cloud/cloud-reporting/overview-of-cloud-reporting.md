The _Reporting_ feature of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud allows you to see a wealth of information about your organization that you can use to monitor, maintain, and enhance your environment.

The <strong>Reporting</strong> node consists of the following sub-nodes, each of which contains the most common datasets organizations typically want to report on:

* <strong>Dashboard -</strong> Contains a summary of all of the information from the other tabs.
* <strong>Software Updates -</strong> Contains a summary of the most common software update-related information.
* <strong>Hardware -</strong> Contains a summary of the most common hardware-related information.
* <strong>Intune  -</strong> Contains a summary of the most common information from your Intune tenant.

<p>The data in the <strong>Intune</strong> sub-node is populated using Microsoft Graph calls to your Intune tenant.</p>
<p>For data to appear and update in the other Reporting sub-nodes, you need to install our client on any devices you wish to collect data from. See [Patch My PC Client](../cloud-administration/manage-client-deployment.md) for more information.</p>
