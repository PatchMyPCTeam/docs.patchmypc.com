The _Reporting_ feature of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud allows you to see a wealth of information about your organization that you can use to monitor, maintain, and enhance your environment.

The **Reporting** node consists of the following sub-nodes, each of which contains the most common datasets organizations typically want to report on:

* **Dashboard -** Contains a summary of all of the information from the other tabs.
* **Software Updates -** Contains a summary of the most common software update-related information.
* **Hardware -** Contains a summary of the most common hardware-related information.
* **Intune  -** Contains a summary of the most common information from your Intune tenant.

<p>The data in the **Intune** sub-node is populated using Microsoft Graph calls to your Intune tenant.</p>
<p>For data to appear and update in the other Reporting sub-nodes, you need to install our client on any devices you wish to collect data from. See [Patch My PC Client](../cloud-administration/manage-client-deployment.md) for more information.</p>
