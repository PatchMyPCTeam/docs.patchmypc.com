The _Reporting_ feature of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud allows you to see a wealth of information about your organization that you can use to monitor, maintain, and enhance your environment.

The **Reporting** node consists of the following sub-nodes, each of which contains the most common datasets organizations typically want to report on:

* **Dashboard -** Contains a summary of all of the information from the other tabs.
* **Software Updates -** Contains a summary of the most common software update-related information.
* **Hardware -** Contains a summary of the most common hardware-related information.
* **Intune  -** Contains a summary of the most common information from your Intune tenant.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

The sub-nodes you see are determined by the license your PMPC Cloud company is running:

* **Enterprise Plus -** You will only see the **Intune** sub-node.
* **Enterprise Premium â€“** You will see all sub-nodes.
{% endhint %}

**Important**

The data in the **Intune** sub-node is populated using Microsoft Graph calls to your Intune tenant.

For data to appear and update in the other Reporting sub-nodes, you need to install our client on any devices you wish to collect data from. See [Patch My PC Client](../cloud-administration/manage-client-deployment.md) for more information.

See [Working with Cloud Reporting](working-with-cloud-reporting.md) for more details on working with the data presented by the Reporting feature.
