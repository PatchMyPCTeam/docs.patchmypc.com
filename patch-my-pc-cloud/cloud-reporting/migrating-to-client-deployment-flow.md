If you were an early adopter of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud Reporting, we provided instructions for installing our by creating a Custom App.

As our in-portal _Client Deployment Flow_ feature is now available, you should use the following instructions to migrate from our old Agent to our new Client.

To migrate to using Client Deployment Flow:

1. Delete the deployment for the Custom App used to install the Agent by following the [Delete a Cloud Deployment](../cloud-deployments/manage-cloud-deployments/delete-a-cloud-deployment.md) process.
2. Next, delete the Custom App you created for deploying the Agent by following the [Delete a Custom App](../custom-apps/delete-a-custom-app.md) process.
3. Follow the [Install the PMPC Client](../cloud-administration/manage-client-deployment.md#install-the-pmpc-client) process, ensuring you meet the required prerequisites.
