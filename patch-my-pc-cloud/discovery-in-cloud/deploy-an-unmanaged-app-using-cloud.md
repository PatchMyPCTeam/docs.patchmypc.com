# Deploy an Unmanaged app using Cloud

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

If an app appears on the <strong>Unmanaged</strong> tab of the <strong>Discovery</strong> node, it means there is no matching deployment in either Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud or our on-premises Publisher for that app.

To deploy an app listed on the <strong>Unmanaged</strong> tab of the <strong>Discovery</strong> node of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud:

1. Navigate to the <strong>Discovery</strong> node.
2.  Click <strong>Deploy</strong> beside the relevant app.\

3. Follow the [Deploying an App](../cloud-deployments/deploying-an-app-using-cloud/) process.

Once you have deployed an app, it will appear in the <strong>Managed</strong> tab.
