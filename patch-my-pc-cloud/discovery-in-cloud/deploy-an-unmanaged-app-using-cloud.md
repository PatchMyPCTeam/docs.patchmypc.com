# Deploy an Unmanaged app using Cloud

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

If an app appears on the **Unmanaged** tab of the **Discovery** node, it means there is no matching deployment in either Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud or our on-premises Publisher for that app.

To deploy an app listed on the **Unmanaged** tab of the **Discovery** node of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud:

1. Navigate to the **Discovery** node.
2.  Click **Deploy** beside the relevant app.\

    \
    The Deployment Wizard starts.\

3. Follow the [Deploying an App](../cloud-deployments/deploying-an-app-using-cloud/) process.

Once you have deployed an app, it will appear in the **Managed** tab.
