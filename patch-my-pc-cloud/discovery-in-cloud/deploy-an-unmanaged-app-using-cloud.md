If an app appears on the **Unmanaged** tab of the **Discovery** node, it means there is no matching deployment in either Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud or our on-premises Publisher for that app.

To deploy an app listed on the **Unmanaged** tab of the **Discovery** node of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud:

1. Navigate to the **Discovery** node.
