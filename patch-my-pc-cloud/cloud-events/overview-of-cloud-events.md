# Overview of Cloud Events

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

An event is written to the **Events** node whenever a user performs a task in the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal. Events are also created if the action a user performs triggers a component to perform an activity.

To access the Events node:

1. Using your portal account, sign in at [https://portal.patchmypc.com/](https://portal.patchmypc.com/).
2.  Navigate to **Events**.\

<p>Events are only held in the portal for 30 days, after which they are automatically groomed from the database. If you wish to keep events longer than 30 days, follow the [Export Events](export-cloud-events.md) process.</p>
