<p>**Important**</p>
<p>We no longer allow customers whose Entra ID domain starts with "m365x" to start a Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud trial. Such customers no longer see the option to start PMPC Cloud Trial and will either need to enter a PMPC Cloud license key or activate their license using their on-premises Publisher license key.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://patchmypc.com/request-quote#feature-comparison">Features by plan</a> for more information on our different subscription levels.</p>
