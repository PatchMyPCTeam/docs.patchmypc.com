On the **Summary** tab, review you have configured the Custom App correctly.

* If you are happy, click **Create**.
* If you need to change something, click **< Prev** to backtrack through the Deployment Wizard to the relevant setting. Make the change, then step back through the wizard to this tab. If everything is now correct, click **Create**.

<p>If the **Create** button is unavailable, check to ensure:</p>
<p>* All required fields on all tabs have been completed.</p>
<p>* If any extra files or folders have been added, check that they have uploaded successfully. If any show as **Failed**, either remove them to proceed or remove them and re-add them</p>
