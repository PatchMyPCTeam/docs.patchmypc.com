<p>If you plan to deploy an EXE-based installer, use our free script to help you extract the required information from the registry. See [Finding properties for EXE-Based Installers](../custom-apps-reference/find-properties-for-exe-based-installers.md) for more information.</p>

The hash for the file is calculated as the file is uploaded to your portal and will show as **completed** once the file has been uploaded.
