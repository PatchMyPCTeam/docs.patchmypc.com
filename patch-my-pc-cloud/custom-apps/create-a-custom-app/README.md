# Create a Custom App

_Applies to: Custom Apps_

Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud allows you to create your own Custom Apps, which are typically in-house developed.

<p>**Note**</p>
<p>If you are using our on-premises Publisher, you should follow the [Publish a Custom App](../publish-a-custom-app.md) process instead.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you are a Managed Service Provider (MSP) wanting to deploy a Custom App to one or more managed companies, see [MSP Custom Apps](../../managed-service-provider/msp-custom-apps/) for more details.</p>

Creating a Custom App involves:

* [Uploading the Primary Installer](upload-the-primary-installer-for-a-custom-app.md)
* [Uploading Extra Folders or Files](custom-apps-file-tab.md) (optional)
* [Configuring General Information](custom-apps-general-information-tab.md)
* [Configuring the Custom App](custom-apps-configuration-tab.md)
* [Configuring Native Detection Rules](custom-apps-detection-rules-tab.md) (optional)
* [Reviewing the Summary](custom-apps-summary-tab.md) (optional but recommended)
