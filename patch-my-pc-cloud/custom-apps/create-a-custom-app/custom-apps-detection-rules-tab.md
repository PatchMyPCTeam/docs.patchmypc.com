<p>Note</p>
<p>Configuring Native Detection Rules is optional.</p>
</blockquote>

If you want to configure Native Detection Rules:

1. On the **Detection Rules** tab, click **Use Custom** to use a custom detection rule, then choose the relevant type of rule from the **Rule Type** dropdown.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>**Note**</p>
<p>You should only choose to use a custom detection method if our default method of scanning the uninstall registry on the endpoint to find a **Display Name** matching your **Apps & Features Name** entry and a **Display Version** that meets or exceeds the **Version** in the **Configuration** tab is unsuitable for this app.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>**Important**</p>
<p>If you configure Detection Rules in the PMPC Cloud portal you:</p>
<p>* Cannot deploy the same app in Publisher as Publisher does not support Native Detection Rules.</p>
<p>* Should not create and manage detection rules in the Intune admin center as they will not be detected and shown in the PMPC Cloud portal.</p>
<p>* Cannot mix our default detection method with custom detection methods for the same Custom App.</p>

7. Go to step 10 if you do not want to add a detection rule that uses the **Use Custom Script** option.
8. If you choose the **Use Custom Script** option, click **Import Script**, then browse to and select the relevant script you want to import.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>**Note**</p>
<p>In the current version:</p>
<p>* We only support PowerShell (.ps1) scripts</p>
<p>* You can only import a single script</p>
<p>* We do not sign your scripts if we use them in one of our deployments. If this is a requirement, you will need to sign the scripts yourself.</p>

A preview of the script is shown in the **Script Preview** window.

10. Repeat the steps in this section to add any additional detection rules.
11. If you are happy you have entered all of the details for the app correctly, click **Create** to complete the creation of the Custom App.\
    \
    However, we recommend you click **Next** to move to the [Summary](custom-apps-summary-tab.md) tab where you can  verify the configuration before saving the Custom App.
