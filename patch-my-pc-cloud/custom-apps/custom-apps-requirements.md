# Custom Apps Requirements

_Applies to: Custom Apps_

To use Patch My PC's (PMPC) Custom Apps, requires you:

* Are running at least version 2.1.20.0 of the PMPC Publisher if you plan to publish your Custom Apps using our on-premises Publisher. If you only plan to use Intune Apps for Cloud to deploy your Custom Apps, Publisher is not required.
* Have an Enterprise Plus, Enterprise Premium or MSP subscription.
* Have already onboarded to the PMPC Cloud and setup the company you want to use to manage your custom applications.
