# Manage New Version Notifications for a Binary Free App

_Applies to: Binary Free Apps for Patch My PC Cloud_

As Binary Free Apps are included in the Patch My PC (PMPC) App Catalog, we automatically monitor for any new versions and include just the metadata (not the installer) in our App Catalog.

However, we do not automatically:

* Notify you a newer version is enabled.
* Deploy the updated version of the Binary Free App, as you need to download the latest version of the installer and manually upload it to our portal.

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>See [Update a Binary Free App](update-a-binary-free-app.md) for more information on updating an existing binary Free App to the latest version.</p>

1.  If you still have the <strong>“<</strong>_<strong>app\_name</strong>_<strong>>” Upload file</strong> screen open, click <strong>Back</strong>, otherwise search for the app in the App Catalog and click it to open its properties screen.\

3.  On the <strong>“</strong>_<strong>\<app-name>”</strong>_<strong>&#x20;Version Notifications</strong> screen, decide whether you want to:\
    \
    • <strong>Notify All users in Company (default) –</strong> Sends an update notification to all users in your portal whenever a new version of the app is added to our App Catalog.

    • <strong>Don’t Notify –</strong> No users are notified of any updates.

    • <strong>Notify Specific Users –</strong> Allows you to specify which users receive the update notification.\

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>If users do not wish to receive the update notification emails, as per the notification email, they will need to contact you to request this. You will then need to reconfigure update notifications for the app to use the <strong>Notify Specific Users</strong> option and then create a custom notification list that excludes those users who do not wish to be notified.</p>
