# Binary Free Apps Overview

_Applies to: Binary Free Apps for Patch My PC Cloud_

There are several apps that Patch My PC (PMPC) cannot automate the download of the installer. This can be for several reasons, such as:

* You need to purchase a license as the vendor blocks access to the download behind a paywall, which you need to sign in to in order to download the installer.
* The installer is offered in a zip archive, which we currently do not support.
* Even though some vendors offer a publicly available installer, you need to accept the EULA before you can initiate the download.

We refer to such apps as _Binary Free Apps_ and this feature allows you to deploy these apps using PMPC Cloud.
