# Manage Cloud Connections

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud and Publisher_

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

Only follow this process if you plan to connect our on-premises Publisher to your Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal.
{% endhint %}

Once onboarded to PMPC Cloud, you can manage all of the instances of Publisher connected to your portal. This allows you to package [Custom Apps](../../custom-apps/) into your OnPrem Publisher.

All connection-related tasks are performed from the **Connections** node of the portal, accessed by navigating to **Settings | Connections.**

The **Connections** page is then displayed, showing any existing connections from Publisher and allowing you to:

* [Add a new Connection](add-a-connection.md)
* [Delete a Connection](delete-a-cloud-connection.md)
