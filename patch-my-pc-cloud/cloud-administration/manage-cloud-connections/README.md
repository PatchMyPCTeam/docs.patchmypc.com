# Manage Cloud Connections

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud and Publisher_

> \*\*Note\*\*
>
> Only follow this process if you plan to connect our on-premises Publisher to your Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal.

Once onboarded to PMPC Cloud, you can manage all of the instances of Publisher connected to your portal. This allows you to package [Custom Apps](../../custom-apps/) into your OnPrem Publisher.

All connection-related tasks are performed from the **Connections** node of the portal, accessed by navigating to **Settings | Connections.**

The **Connections** page is then displayed, showing any existing connections from Publisher and allowing you to:

* [Add a new Connection](add-a-connection.md)
* [Delete a Connection](delete-a-cloud-connection.md)
