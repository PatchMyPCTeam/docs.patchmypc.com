# Delete Cloud Branding

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

> \*\*Important\*\*
>
> You cannot delete a Branding App unless it has been deployed successfully or failed to deploy.
>
> Also:
>
> \* Each Branding App must contain at least one localization. You cannot delete all localizations for a branding app.
>
> \* Deleting a Branding App only removes it from Intune and does not remove any custom logos, files or localizations from your end-user devices. To do this, you need to create an \[Uninstall Branding App]\(uninstall-cloud-branding.md).
