# Delete Cloud Branding

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**

You cannot delete a Branding App unless it has been deployed successfully or failed to deploy.

Also:

* Each Branding App must contain at least one localization. You cannot delete all localizations for a branding app.
* Deleting a Branding App only removes it from Intune and does not remove any custom logos, files or localizations from your end-user devices. To do this, you need to create an [Uninstall Branding App](uninstall-cloud-branding.md).

To delete a Branding App:

1. Navigate to **Settings | Branding**

![Navigating to &#x22;Settings | Branding&#x22;](/_images/image-%282506%29.png-"Navigating-to-&#x22;Settings-|-Branding&#x22;" "Navigating to &#x22;Settings | Branding&#x22;")

2. Click the ellipsis (`â‹®`) button beside the relevant Branding App and select **Delete**.

![Selecting &#x22;Delete&#x22; from the ellipsis menu](/_images/image-%282676%29.png-"Selecting-&#x22;Delete&#x22;-from-the-ellipsis-menu" "Selecting &#x22;Delete&#x22; from the ellipsis menu")

3. Read the **Are you sure** dialog box, and if you want to continue, click **Yes**.
