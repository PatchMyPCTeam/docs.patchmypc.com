# Delete Cloud Branding

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**

You cannot delete a Branding App unless it has been deployed successfully or failed to deploy.

Also:

* Each Branding App must contain at least one localization. You cannot delete all localizations for a branding app.
* Deleting a Branding App only removes it from Intune and does not remove any custom logos, files or localizations from your end-user devices. To do this, you need to create an [Uninstall Branding App](uninstall-cloud-branding.md).
{% endhint %}

To delete a Branding App:

1. Navigate to **Settings | Branding**
