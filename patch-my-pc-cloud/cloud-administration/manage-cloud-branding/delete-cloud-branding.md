# Delete Cloud Branding

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>**Important**</p>
<p>You cannot delete a Branding App unless it has been deployed successfully or failed to deploy.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>* Each Branding App must contain at least one localization. You cannot delete all localizations for a branding app.</p>
<p>* Deleting a Branding App only removes it from Intune and does not remove any custom logos, files or localizations from your end-user devices. To do this, you need to create an [Uninstall Branding App](uninstall-cloud-branding.md).</p>

To delete a Branding App:

1. Navigate to **Settings | Branding**
