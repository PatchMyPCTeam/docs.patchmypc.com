# Modify Cloud Naming Conventions

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

Once you have created naming conventions in Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud, you can modify them as required.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

Once you’ve saved any changes to your existing Naming Conventions, these changes will apply to all deployments created from this point forward.

Any existing deployments are not automatically updated until the next sync happens, which by default is daily at 2 AM local time, based on the country you selected when you onboarded to Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud.

If you want to apply the changes to any existing deployments before the next sync runs, you can either [Edit a Deployment](../../cloud-deployments/manage-cloud-deployments/edit-a-cloud-deployment.md) or [Recreate a Deployment](../../cloud-deployments/manage-cloud-deployments/recreate-a-cloud-deployment.md). Either of these actions will apply the new naming conventions to the deployment.
{% endhint %}

To modify Naming Conventions:

1. Navigate to **Settings | Naming**.
2.  Click on the relevant tab for the type of apps whose naming convention you want to modify.\
