# Manage Cloud Naming Conventions

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

The _Naming Conventions_ feature allows you to configure custom naming conventions for all deployments created in Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud. It is designed to help you standardize the naming convention across all PMPC Cloud deployments.

You can configure naming conventions for both:

* <strong>Update-only apps –</strong> Deployment of apps that incorporate <strong>Update Only</strong> assignments.
* <strong>Install and Update Apps –</strong> Deployment of apps created in Intune that incorporate <strong>Available</strong>, <strong>Required</strong>, and <strong>Uninstall</strong> assignments.

All naming convention-related tasks are performed from the <strong>Naming</strong> node, accessed by navigating to <strong>Settings | Naming</strong>.

The <strong>Naming Conventions</strong> page is then displayed, allowing you to:

* [Configure Naming Conventions](configure-cloud-naming-conventions.md)
* [Modify Naming Conventions](modify-cloud-naming-conventions.md)
