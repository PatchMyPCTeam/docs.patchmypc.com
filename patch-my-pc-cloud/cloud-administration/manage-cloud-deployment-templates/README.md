# Manage Cloud Deployment Templates

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

The _Deployment Templates_ (_Templates_) feature of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud allows you to configure a template containing various standard settings for PMPC Cloud deployments. Once created, these templates can be used whenever you deploy an app using PMPC Cloud to ensure consistency across your deployments.

> **Note**
>
> See \[Using Templates in Deployments]\(../../cloud-deployments/use-a-template-in-cloud-deployments.md) for details on using templates in new deployments.

All deployment template-related tasks are performed from the **Templates** node of the portal, accessed by navigating to **Settings | Templates**.
