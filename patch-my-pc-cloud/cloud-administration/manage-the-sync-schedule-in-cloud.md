# Manage the Sync Schedule in Cloud

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

By default, every day our sync job runs at 2 AM Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to check if your deployments within Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud are up-to-date.

The _Sync Schedule_ allows you to set a different time and frequency for the sync job to run.

To set a different time or frequency for the sync job:

1.  Navigate to <strong>Settings | Sync Schedule</strong>.\

### Other Frequencies

You can also choose to run the Sync Schedule on a Weekly or Monthly basis.

<p><strong>Important</strong></p>
<p>If you are using [Update Rings](../cloud-deployments/cloud-update-rings/), we recommend running the Sync Schedule daily to avoid potential issues with the timing of updates and the overall performance of this feature.</p>
<p>This is why the warning message about this is displayed whenever you select either the <strong>Weekly</strong> or <strong>Monthly</strong> options.</p>
</blockquote>

If you choose the <strong>Weekly</strong> option, as well as the time the sync runs, you can also choose which days it runs on.

If you choose the <strong>Monthly</strong> option, as well as the time the sync runs, you can also choose to run it on a specific day of the month or a recurring pattern.
