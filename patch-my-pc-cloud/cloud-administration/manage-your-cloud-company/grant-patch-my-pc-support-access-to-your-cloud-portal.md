5. Select the relevant level of access you want to grant from the **Access Type** dropdown:
   1. **Cloud Admin Read Only –** PMPC Support can only see your portal but cannot make any changes.
   2. **Full Admin –** PMPC Support can impersonate you and have full access to your portal.

**Important**

**Full Admin** does not include access management, i.e., PMPC cannot invite another user to your company on your behalf. Also, any actions PMPC perform are logged in the **Events** area, where you can review them as required.
