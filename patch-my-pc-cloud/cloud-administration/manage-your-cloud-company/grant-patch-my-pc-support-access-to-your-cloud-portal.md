5. Select the relevant level of access you want to grant from the <strong>Access Type</strong> dropdown:
   1. <strong>Cloud Admin Read Only –</strong> PMPC Support can only see your portal but cannot make any changes.
   2. <strong>Full Admin –</strong> PMPC Support can impersonate you and have full access to your portal.

<p><strong>Important</strong></p>
<p><strong>Full Admin</strong> does not include access management, i.e., PMPC cannot invite another user to your company on your behalf. Also, any actions PMPC perform are logged in the <strong>Events</strong> area, where you can review them as required.</p>
