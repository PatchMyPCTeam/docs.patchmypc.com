# Enable Cloud Preview Features

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

_Preview Features_ in Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud are pre-release features we are developing, which may not be functionally complete or contain bugs. When you enable **Preview Features**, you will gain access to all features we have marked as Public Preview, plus any new ones we release in the future will be automatically enabled.

> **Important**
>
> By enabling this option, you agree to accept that you may encounter some functionality issues and bugs.
>
> Disabling this option only prevents new pre-release features from automatically being enabled in your company. It does not remove any previously enabled preview features, which will remain active.
>
> Also, enabling this option only enables Public Preview features. To gain access to any features we mark as Private Preview requires you to email a request to \[insiders@patchmypc.com]\(mailto:insiders@patchmypc.com).
