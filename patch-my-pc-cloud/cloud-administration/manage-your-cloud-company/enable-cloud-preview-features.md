# Enable Cloud Preview Features

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

_Preview Features_ in Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud are pre-release features we are developing, which may not be functionally complete or contain bugs. When you enable **Preview Features**, you will gain access to all features we have marked as Public Preview, plus any new ones we release in the future will be automatically enabled.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

By enabling this option, you agree to accept that you may encounter some functionality issues and bugs.

Disabling this option only prevents new pre-release features from automatically being enabled in your company. It does not remove any previously enabled preview features, which will remain active.

Also, enabling this option only enables Public Preview features. To gain access to any features we mark as Private Preview requires you to email a request to [insiders@patchmypc.com](mailto:insiders@patchmypc.com).

To enable Preview Features:

1. Navigate to the **Company** node.
