# Enable Cloud Preview Features

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

_Preview Features_ in Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud are pre-release features we are developing, which may not be functionally complete or contain bugs. When you enable <strong>Preview Features</strong>, you will gain access to all features we have marked as Public Preview, plus any new ones we release in the future will be automatically enabled.

<p><strong>Important</strong></p>
<p>By enabling this option, you agree to accept that you may encounter some functionality issues and bugs.</p>
<p>Disabling this option only prevents new pre-release features from automatically being enabled in your company. It does not remove any previously enabled preview features, which will remain active.</p>
<p>Also, enabling this option only enables Public Preview features. To gain access to any features we mark as Private Preview requires you to email a request to [insiders@patchmypc.com](mailto:insiders@patchmypc.com).</p>
