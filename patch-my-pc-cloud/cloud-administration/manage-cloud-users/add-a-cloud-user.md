# Add a Cloud User

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

Users can be added to the PMPC Cloud portal by:

* [Invitation from an Administrator](add-a-cloud-user.md#invitation-from-an-administrator)
* [Users requesting access](add-a-cloud-user.md#users-requesting-access)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

Users can also access the portal if they are members of one or more Entra ID Security Groups that have been added to the portal.

If a user has been added directly to the portal using the processes detailed in this article and they are also a member of an Entra ID Security Group that is granted access to the same PMPC Cloud company, they will appear both under the **Users** tab and a member of the relevant Entra ID Security Group(s) when following the [View an Entra ID Group's Membership](using-entra-id-security-groups-in-cloud/view-an-entra-id-groups-membership-in-cloud.md) process.
