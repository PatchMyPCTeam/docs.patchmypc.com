# Manage Cloud Access Requests

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

Access to the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal is controlled through either an access request initiated by a user or an invitation initiated by an existing administrative user.

This section details how to manage Access Requests.

> See \[Managing Invitations]\(../manage-cloud-invitations/) for more information on invitations.

There are two ways to manage Access Requests to join your PMPC Cloud portal:

* Clicking **Review Request** in the email generated when the user requests access.
* Navigating to **Settings | Users | Pending Approval**.

> \*\*Note\*\*

> Clicking \*\*Review Request\*\* in the email takes you to the \*\*Pending Approval\*\* page. To see an example of the access request email, see \[Example Access Request email]\(../../../cloud-reference/cloud-email-reference/example-cloud-access-request-email.md).
