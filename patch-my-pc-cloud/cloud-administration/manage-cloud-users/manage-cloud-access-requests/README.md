# Manage Cloud Access Requests

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

Access to the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal is controlled through either an access request initiated by a user or an invitation initiated by an existing administrative user.

This section details how to manage Access Requests.

There are two ways to manage Access Requests to join your PMPC Cloud portal:

* Clicking <strong>Review Request</strong> in the email generated when the user requests access.
* Navigating to <strong>Settings | Users | Pending Approval</strong>.

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>Clicking <strong>Review Request</strong> in the email takes you to the <strong>Pending Approval</strong> page. To see an example of the access request email, see [Example Access Request email](../../../cloud-reference/cloud-email-reference/example-cloud-access-request-email.md).</p>
