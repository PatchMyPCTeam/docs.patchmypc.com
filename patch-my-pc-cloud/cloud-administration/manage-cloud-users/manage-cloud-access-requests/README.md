# Manage Cloud Access Requests

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

Access to the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal is controlled through either an access request initiated by a user or an invitation initiated by an existing administrative user.

This section details how to manage Access Requests.

See [Managing Invitations](../manage-cloud-invitations/) for more information on invitations.
{% endhint %}

There are two ways to manage Access Requests to join your PMPC Cloud portal:

* Clicking **Review Request** in the email generated when the user requests access.
* Navigating to **Settings | Users | Pending Approval**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

Clicking **Review Request** in the email takes you to the **Pending Approval** page. To see an example of the access request email, see [Example Access Request email](../../../cloud-reference/cloud-email-reference/example-cloud-access-request-email.md).
