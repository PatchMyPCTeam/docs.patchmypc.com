# Copy a Cloud Invitation’s link

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

You can use the **Copy invite link** functionality to invite users to your Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal who don’t have a mailbox associated with their Entra ID (for example, an admin account).

To copy the invitation link:

1.  Click the **Copy invite link** icon beside the relevant invitation.\

2.  Paste the link and give it to whoever needs it. The link looks something similar to:
