# Copy a Cloud Invitation’s link

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

You can use the **Copy invite link** functionality to invite users to your Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal who don’t have a mailbox associated with their Entra ID (for example, an admin account).

To copy the invitation link:

1.  Click the **Copy invite link** icon beside the relevant invitation.\

    \
    The **Success - Invitation link copied** notification is displayed, confirming the link has been copied to your clipboard.\

2.  Paste the link and give it to whoever needs it. The link looks something similar to:

    [https://portal.patchmypc.com/accept-invite?invitationId=_\<invite\_ID>_](https://portal.patchmypc.com/accept-invite?invitationId=%3cinvite_ID%3e)
