**Note**

We only display the Entra ID of the user, not their actual name, as this requires extra permissions. You will either need to view the group in Entra ID or search for the user’s Entra ID to discover their name.
{% endhint %}

4. Click **Close** to close the **Group Members** screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

If a user has been added directly to the portal using the [Add a User](../add-a-cloud-user.md) process and they are also a member of an Entra ID Security Group that is granted access to the same PMPC Cloud company, they will appear both under the **Users** tab and as a member of the relevant  Entra ID Security Group(s).
