# Create a Cloud Email notification

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

You can create an email notification in Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud to automatically receive a daily email report with details of all deployments that have been created and updated after the daily sync with our publishing service has been completed.

<p>**Note**</p>
<p>We strongly recommend you create at least one email notification so you can easily track what is happening in your environment. See [Example Updates Report Email](../../cloud-reference/cloud-email-reference/example-cloud-updates-report-email.md) for an example of the Updates Report email you will receive six hours after the daily sync job has run.</p>
