# Create a Slack Webhook

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

To create a Slack Webhook for use in Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud:

1. Create the channel in Slack you want to post our alerts to. For example, <strong>pmpc-alerts</strong>
2. Follow the [Sending messages using incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>We recommend using <strong>Patch My PC</strong> as the <strong>App Name</strong> to allow you to distinguish it easily from other apps.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Tip</strong></p>
<p>You can download a copy of our logo to use with your webhook at <a href="https://patchmypc.com/patch-my-pc-logos-wallpapers-and-brand-resources">Patch My PC Logos, Wallpapers, and Brand Resources</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

At the end of the process, you should have a unique URL that looks something like:

https://hooks.slack.com/services/T075HFX36TX/B075NV2J8G4/<_long\_alphanumeric\_string_>
