# Create a Slack Webhook

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

To create a Slack Webhook for use in Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud:

1. Create the channel in Slack you want to post our alerts to. For example, **pmpc-alerts**
2. Follow the [Sending messages using incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

> \*\*Note\*\*
>
> We recommend using \*\*Patch My PC\*\* as the \*\*App Name\*\* to allow you to distinguish it easily from other apps.

> \*\*Tip\*\*
>
> You can download a copy of our logo to use with your webhook at [Patch My PC Logos, Wallpapers, and Brand Resources](https://patchmypc.com/patch-my-pc-logos-wallpapers-and-brand-resources).

At the end of the process, you should have a unique URL that looks something like:

https://hooks.slack.com/services/T075HFX36TX/B075NV2J8G4/<_long\_alphanumeric\_string_>
