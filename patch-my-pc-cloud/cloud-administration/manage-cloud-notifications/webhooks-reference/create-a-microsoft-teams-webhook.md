# Create a Microsoft Teams Webhook

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

To create incoming webhooks with Workflows for Microsoft Teams, follow the **Set up an incoming webhook workflow from a template** section of [Create incoming webhooks with Workflows for Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/create-incoming-webhooks-with-workflows-for-microsoft-teams-8ae491c7-0394-4861-ba59-055e33f75498).

> \*\*Note\*\*
>
> We recommend using \*\*Patch My PC\*\* as the Incoming Webhook's name to allow you to easily distinguish it from other webhooks.

> \*\*Tip\*\*
>
> You can download a copy of our logo to use with your webhook at [Patch My PC Logos, Wallpapers, and Brand Resources](https://patchmypc.com/patch-my-pc-logos-wallpapers-and-brand-resources).

At the end of the process, you should have a unique URL that looks something like:

https://patchmypc.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/b53ef332-ae0a-48b8-b8c0-4d786e013c1e@b79783df-131e-4d00-8303-6f66c0fa4bfb/IncomingWebhook/994f68a3569b4364bab362288c857b51/<_long\_alphanumeric\_string>_
