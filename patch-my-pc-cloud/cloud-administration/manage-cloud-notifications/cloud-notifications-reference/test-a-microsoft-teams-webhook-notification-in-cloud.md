### Testing a Teams webhook notification at the time of creation

1. Follow the [Create a Microsoft Teams Webhook Notification](../create-a-microsoft-teams-webhook-notification-in-cloud.md) process.

    \
    The portal will send a test Teams notification and display the **Success - Test webhook has been sent** notification.\
