### Testing a Teams webhook notification at the time of creation

1. Follow the [Create a Microsoft Teams Webhook Notification](../create-a-microsoft-teams-webhook-notification-in-cloud.md) process.
2.  Once you have entered and saved the webhook URL, click the small envelope beside the webhook URL (![](../../../../_images/image%20%281900).png>)) to send a test message.\

    \
    The portal will send a test Teams notification and display the **Success - Test webhook has been sent** notification.\


    ![&#x22;Success - Test webhook has been sent&#x22; notification](../../../../_images/image%20%281914%29.png%20"&#x22;Success%20-%20Test%20webhook%20has%20been%20sent&#x22;%20notification")
