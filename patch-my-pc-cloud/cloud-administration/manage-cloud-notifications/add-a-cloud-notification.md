**Note**

Given [Microsoft's announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/) to retire Office 365 connectors (which includes Webhooks), we are already working on a Workflow solution that will be available well in advance of Microsoft's retirement plans. Stay tuned for updates.
