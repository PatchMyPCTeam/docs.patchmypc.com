# Create a Webhook notification in Cloud

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

You can create a webhook to allow the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal to send you a notification of any newly created/updated deployments or whenever we release new versions of an app or update.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

You need to have already created the webhook to be able to configure a notification to use it. To create a webhook, follow either the [Creating a Microsoft Teams Webhook](webhooks-reference/create-a-microsoft-teams-webhook.md) process or the [Creating a Slack Webhook](webhooks-reference/create-a-slack-webhook.md) process.
{% endhint %}

To create a webhook notification:

From the **Add Webhook** dropdown, select the type of webhook you want to create:

* [Microsoft Teams](create-a-microsoft-teams-webhook-notification-in-cloud.md)
* [Slack](create-a-slack-webhook-notification-in-cloud.md)
