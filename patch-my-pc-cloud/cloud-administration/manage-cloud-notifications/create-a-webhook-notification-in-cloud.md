# Create a Webhook notification in Cloud

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

> **Note**
>
> You can create a webhook to allow the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal to send you a notification of any newly created/updated deployments or whenever we release new versions of an app or update.

> **Important**
>
> You need to have already created the webhook to be able to configure a notification to use it. To create a webhook, follow either the \[Creating a Microsoft Teams Webhook]\(webhooks-reference/create-a-microsoft-teams-webhook.md) process or the \[Creating a Slack Webhook]\(webhooks-reference/create-a-slack-webhook.md) process.

To create a webhook notification:

From the **Add Webhook** dropdown, select the type of webhook you want to create:

* [Microsoft Teams](create-a-microsoft-teams-webhook-notification-in-cloud.md)
* [Slack](create-a-slack-webhook-notification-in-cloud.md)
