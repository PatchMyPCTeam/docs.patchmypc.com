**Note**

Reviewing the **Summary** tab is optional, but recommended.

The **Summary** tab of the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud deployment wizard provides a summary of the deployment so you can confirm that it is configured correctly before you create it.

If you are happy click **Deploy**.\

If you need to change something, click **< Prev** to backtrack through the Deployment Wizard to the relevant setting. Make the change, then step back through the wizard to this page. If everything is now correct, click **Deploy**.
