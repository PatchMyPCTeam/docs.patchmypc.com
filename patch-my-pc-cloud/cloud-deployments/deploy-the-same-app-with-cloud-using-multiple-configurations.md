# Deploy the same App with Cloud using multiple configurations

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

You can deploy the same app with different configurations using Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud.

<p>**Important**</p>
<p>For this to work, you must use a different **Display Name** for the deployment. If you don't, you will receive the [deployment with the same name already exists](../cloud-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-cloud-deployments/a-deployment-with-the-same-name-less-than-deployment_name-greater-than-already-exists-error-when-dep.md) error.</p>
</blockquote>

To deploy the same app with a different configuration:

1. Sign in to the portal at [https://portal.patchmypc.com/](https://portal.patchmypc.com/).
2. Locate the required app on the **App Catalog** page.
