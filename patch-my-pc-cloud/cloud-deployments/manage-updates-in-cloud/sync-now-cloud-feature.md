<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>If an app has more than one version of an update available, using <strong>Sync Now</strong> ensures it is updated to the latest version as soon as possible, which could impact your users. So, think carefully before using this.</p>

1.  Click on the relevant deployment which has been resumed.\
