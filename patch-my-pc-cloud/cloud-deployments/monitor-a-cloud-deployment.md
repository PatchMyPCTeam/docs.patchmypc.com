# Monitor a Cloud Deployment

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

All Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud deployments include a status.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Important</strong></p>
<p>As PMPC Cloud is performing the deployment and not Microsoft Intune, you can only view the status of these deployments from within the PMPC portal. The status of PMPC Cloud deployments is not visible from within the Intune admin center.</p>
</blockquote>

To see the status of a deployment:

1. Sign in to the portal at [https://portal.patchmypc.com/](https://portal.patchmypc.com/).
2.  Navigate to the <strong>Deployments</strong> node.\

    \
    The <strong>Deployments</strong> page loads, showing all current deployments. \
    \
    The <strong>Status</strong> column shows the current status of each deployment, which will be one of the following:

* <strong>Success –</strong> The application was successfully created in Intune.
* <strong>In Progress –</strong> The application is being created in Intune.
* <strong>Failed –</strong> The application failed to be created in Intune.
