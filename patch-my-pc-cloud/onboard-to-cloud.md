{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

This dialog box is for the Enterprise Application Registration process. We require these permissions to authenticate you.

See [Permissions required for Patch My PC Cloud](cloud-reference/cloud-permissions-reference/permissions-required-for-patch-my-pc-cloud.md) for more details.

You do not need to check the optional **Consent on behalf of your organization** checkbox, which is only visible to Global or Application administrators.

However, if you are a Global or Application administrator and want to accept the request to read the profile for all users in your tenant and prevent this message from being displayed for them, you should check it.

Either way, checking or unchecking this checkbox does not affect PMPC Cloud functionality.

Once you accept the permissions, you will not see this dialog box again on subsequent sign-ins.
