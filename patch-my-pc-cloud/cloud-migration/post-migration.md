# Post Migration

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**

This feature is currently only available through an invitation-only Private Preview, as both it and the documentation are under development, incomplete, and subject to change.

Please do not share links to these docs with others outside of the Private Preview.

Once this feature is released, it will be announced and this banner removed.
{% endhint %}

As you may still need to deploy migrated applications to on-premises servers through ConfigMgr or non-Intune managed clients, we do not recommend you perform any kind of cleanup post-migration.
