# Signing up for a Cloud macOS trial

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>**Important**</p>
<p>This documentation is for a pre-release feature still under development and, therefore, incomplete. As a result, both functionality and documentation are subject to change.</p>
<p>Once this feature is released, it will be announced and this banner removed.</p>
</blockquote>

As Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud supports Apple macOS devices, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial to see if it meets your needs before committing to purchasing licenses.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>**Note**</p>
<p>Signing up for a macOS trial does not apply to customers using a Managed Service Provider (MSP) license of Patch My PC Cloud, as this license type includes macOS by default.</p>
</blockquote>

To sign up for the trial, you can click **Try it now** in the following locations:

* The header notification area
* The banner shown at the top of the App Catalog

![Clicking "Try it now" to start the macOS free trial](/_images/image-(21Try-it-now "Clicking \"Try it now\" to start the macOS free trial").png "Clicking “Try it now” to start the macOS free trial")

* Under the **macOS** option when creating a deployment.

When you click **Try it now**, you then have the option of either:

* Typing or using the controls to enter the total number of devices you want to license for the trial in the **Enter the total number of macOS devices to license** box.
* Clicking **Request a Quote** to request a quote for a non-trial license to manage your macOS devices using PMPC Cloud.

Once you’ve entered the number of devices for the trial, click **Start Now**

![Clicking "Start Now"](/_images/image-(24Start-Now "Clicking \"Start Now\"").png "Clicking “Start Now”")

The **Your30-day trial expires on <**_**expiry date**_**>** confirmation is shown.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>**Note**</p>
<p>If you sign up for a macOS trial from an existing PMPC Cloud Company that is also partway through a trial, the expiry date of the macOS trial will match that of the existing Windows trial.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you are an existing PMPC Cloud customer and your license expires within the next 30 days, your macOS trial will also expire on the same date as your existing license.</p>
<p>If you switch your company between different PMPC Cloud license keys during a macOS trial, the expiry date of the macOS trial does not change. However, if you are running a full (non-trial) macOS license, the expiration date of this license will be the same as the main company license.</p>

Make a note of the expiry date and our contact details in case you need to contact us, then click **Close**

Once your trial has started, you see the following countdown at the top of the portal advising you of how many days you have left on your trial.

When your trial expires, you see the following notification at the top of the portal:

**Your macOS trial license has expired. To continue managing macOS apps, license your macOS devices today: Request a Quote**

Click **Request a Quote** if you would like to receive a quote for purchasing macOS licenses and provide the requested information.

### Once your macOS trial expires

At the end of your macOS trial, if you chose not to obtain paid licenses:

* You will be unable to create any new macOS deployments or modify/delete any existing macOS deployments.
* If a new version of a macOS app is released that you deployed during your trial, the updated version will not be deployed.
* If you used the Discovery feature to [Manage Cloud Managed Apps](../discovery-in-cloud/manage-cloud-managed-apps.md) for macOS devices during your trial, once your trial expires, any macOS-related apps will remain in the **Managed** tab of Discovery but will be greyed out, and you won’t be able to perform any actions on them. Once you enter a valid license key, you will be able to create new macOS deployments and manage any existing ones created by your expired trial.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>**Tip**</p>
<p>If you have created deployments during your trial and do not plan to purchase a macOS license, we recommend deleting any macOS deployments before your trial expires. We do not delete such deployments automatically in case you decide to purchase a macOS license after your trial expires, as if you enter a valid license key, you will be able to create new macOS deployments and manage any existing ones created by your expired trial.</p>
