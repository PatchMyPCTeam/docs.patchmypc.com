# Filter by OS in Cloud

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

With the addition of macOS support to Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud, the App Catalog can now be filtered by operating system (OS) by either:

* [Switching to List view](filter-by-os-in-cloud.md#switching-to-list-view)
* [Using the OS Filter](filter-by-os-in-cloud.md#using-the-os-filter)

### Switching to List View

To switch to List view:

On the **App Catalog** page, click the **List View** button.

![Clicking the “List View” button](../../_images/image%20%282279%29.png%20"Clicking%20the%20\"List%20View\"%20button")

The App Catalog updates to show the list of available apps in list view. The new **OS** column shows which operating systems each app can be deployed to.
