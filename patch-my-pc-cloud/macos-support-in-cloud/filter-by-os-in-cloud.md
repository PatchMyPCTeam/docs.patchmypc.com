_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

With the addition of macOS support to Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud, the App Catalog can now be filtered by operating system (OS) by either:

* [Switching to List view](filter-by-os-in-cloud.md#switching-to-list-view)
* [Using the OS Filter](filter-by-os-in-cloud.md#using-the-os-filter)

### Switching to List View

On the **App Catalog** page, click the **List View** button.
