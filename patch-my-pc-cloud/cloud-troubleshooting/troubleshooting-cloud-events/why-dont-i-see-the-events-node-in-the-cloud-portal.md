# Why don’t I see the “Events” node in the Cloud portal?

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

### SYMPTOMS

I have signed into the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal, but I don’t see the **Events** node.

### CAUSE

This is because your portal account is not a **Full Admin**. Only users assigned the **Full Admin** role can see the **Events** node.

### RESOLUTION

To resolve this issue, ask your portal administrator to upgrade your portal account to **Full Admin** by following the [Modifying the Role assigned to a User](../../cloud-administration/manage-cloud-users/modify-a-cloud-user.md#modifying-the-role-assigned-to-a-user) section of the [Modify a User](../../cloud-administration/manage-cloud-users/modify-a-cloud-user.md) process.

Once you have been granted the **Full Admin** role, sign out of the portal and back in again to see the **Events** node.
