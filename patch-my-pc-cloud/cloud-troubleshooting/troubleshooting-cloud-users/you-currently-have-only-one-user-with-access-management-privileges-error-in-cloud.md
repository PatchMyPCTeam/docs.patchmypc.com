# “You currently have only one user with Access Management privileges” error in Cloud

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

### SYMPTOMS

Why do I see the following message at the top of my screen when signing into the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal?

**You currently have only one user with Access Management privileges. To prevent access issues please add a second user with Access Management privileges.**

### CAUSE

This problem occurs because, as the message states, your environment only has a single user configured with Access Management privileges.&#x20;

If, for some reason, this person leaves or forgets their password, you will be unable to access your environment.

### RESOLUTION

To resolve this issue, click **Fix Access** and follow the [Add Users](../../cloud-administration/manage-cloud-users/add-a-cloud-user.md) process.

This message will disappear once you have at least two users with Access Management privileges.
