# Why don’t I see the “Users” node in the Cloud portal?

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

### SYMPTOMS

I have signed into the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal, but I don’t see the **Users** node.

### CAUSE

This is because your portal account has not been granted **Access Management** privileges.

### RESOLUTION

To resolve this issue, ask a user with **Access Management** privileges to follow the [Managing Access Management privileges for a User](../../cloud-administration/manage-cloud-users/modify-a-cloud-user.md#managing-access-management-privileges-for-a-user) process in the [Modify a User](../../cloud-administration/manage-cloud-users/modify-a-cloud-user.md) article.

Once you have granted the user **Access Management** privileges, if they refresh their portal the **Users** node appears.
