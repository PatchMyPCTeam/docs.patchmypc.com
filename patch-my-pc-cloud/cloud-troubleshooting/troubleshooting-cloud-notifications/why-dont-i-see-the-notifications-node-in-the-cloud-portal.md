# Why don’t I see the “Notifications” node in the Cloud portal?

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

### SYMPTOMS

I have signed into the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud portal, but I don’t see the **Notifications** node under **Settings**.

### CAUSE

This is because your portal is not connected to an Intune tenant.

<p>**Note**</p>
<p>Not having an Intune tenant connected will also prevent the **Branding** node from appearing.</p>
</blockquote>

### RESOLUTION

To resolve this issue, follow the [Connecting to an Intune tenant](../../cloud-administration/manage-your-environments-in-cloud/manage-cloud-intune-tenants.md#connecting-to-an-intune-tenant) section of the [Managing Intune tenants](../../cloud-administration/manage-your-environments-in-cloud/manage-cloud-intune-tenants.md) process.

Once your portal has been connected to an Intune tenant you will see the **Notifications** node.
