# Why don't I see the ellipsis to edit my Environment or License in the Cloud portal?

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

### SYMPTOMS

I am trying to edit my environment in Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud, but I don’t see the ellipsis (**⋮**) on the **Environments** page that allows me to choose the **Edit Environment** or **Edit License** option.

### CAUSE

This problem is caused by the browser window being too narrow to display the ellipsis.

### RESOLUTION

To resolve this issue, widen the browser window, and the ellipsis will appear.

The scrollbar under the table gives you a visual clue that the browser window is not wide enough to display everything.

If you compare this image to the one where the ellipsis is visible, you don’t see the scrollbar.
