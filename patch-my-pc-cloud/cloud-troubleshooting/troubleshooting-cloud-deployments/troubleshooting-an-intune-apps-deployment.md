# Troubleshooting an Intune Apps Deployment

_Applies to: Intune Apps for Cloud_

As Intune Apps for Cloud (Intune Apps) is reliant on your Intune tenant, if you encounter any problems, first check your **Tenant Status** (located under **Tenant Administration** in the **Microsoft Intune admin center**).

If a deployment shows a status of **Failed**, you should follow the [Recreate a Deployment](../../cloud-deployments/manage-cloud-deployments/recreate-a-cloud-deployment.md) process.
