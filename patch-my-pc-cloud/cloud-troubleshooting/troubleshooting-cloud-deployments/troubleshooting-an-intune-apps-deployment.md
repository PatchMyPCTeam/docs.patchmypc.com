# Troubleshooting an Intune Apps Deployment

_Applies to: Intune Apps for Cloud_

As Intune Apps for Cloud (Intune Apps) is reliant on your Intune tenant, if you encounter any problems, first check your <strong>Tenant Status</strong> (located under <strong>Tenant Administration</strong> in the <strong>Microsoft Intune admin center</strong>).

If a deployment shows a status of <strong>Failed</strong>, you should follow the [Recreate a Deployment](../../cloud-deployments/manage-cloud-deployments/recreate-a-cloud-deployment.md) process.
