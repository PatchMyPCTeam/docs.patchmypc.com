# Example Binary Free App Successfully Updated Email

_Applies to: Binary Free Apps_

Once you upload the latest version of the installer for a new version of a Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud Binary Free App, the next time our daily sync job runs, any existing deployments will be updated to the latest version. This will trigger a notification email containing the details to be sent to any users configured for [New Version Notifications](../../binary-free-apps/manage-new-version-notifications-for-a-binary-free-app.md).

The email is sent from the [noreply@patchmypc.com](mailto:noreply@patchmypc.com) mailbox with the subject **Updates Report for Patch My PC**.
