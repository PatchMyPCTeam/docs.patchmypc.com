# Example Binary Free App Update Email

_Applies to: Binary Free Apps_

Whenever we add a new version of a Binary Free App you have deployed to our App Catalog using Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud, any users configured for [New Version Notifications](https://docs.patchmypc.com/patch-my-pc-cloud/binary-free-apps/manage-new-version-notifications-for-a-binary-free-app) will receive a notification email.

The email is sent from the [noreply@patchmypc.com](mailto:noreply@patchmypc.com) mailbox with the subject **“<**_**app\_name**_**>” Update Available**.
