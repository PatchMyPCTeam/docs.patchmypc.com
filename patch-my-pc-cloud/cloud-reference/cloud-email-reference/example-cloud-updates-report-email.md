# Example Cloud Updates Report Email

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

Whenever the Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud [Sync Schedule](../../cloud-administration/manage-the-sync-schedule-in-cloud.md) runs, if the version of any apps already deployed is updated, the **Updates Report** email is sent to any email addresses configured for [Email Notification](../../cloud-administration/manage-cloud-notifications/create-a-cloud-email-notification.md) with the relevant details.

The email is sent from the [noreply@patchmypc.com](mailto:noreply@patchmypc.com) mailbox with the subject **Updates report for Patch My PC**.

An example is shown below.
