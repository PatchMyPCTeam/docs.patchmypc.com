<p>**Note**</p>
<p>Your account must have the **Global Administrator** role in Entra ID to approve our enterprise application. Using an account with the **Application Administrator** role will not work as our app requires Microsoft Graph permissions.</p>

<p>**\*** The **Read and write Microsoft Intune configuration** permission is required to manage blocking apps in the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) profile directly from the PMPC Cloud portal. This is the only feature in our solution that relies on this permission.</p>
<p>We understand this permission may seem broad, but Microsoft does not offer a more granular alternative for updating the blocking apps feature in ESP profiles. If you have concerns and choose to revoke this permission from the **Patch My PC Cloud** Enterprise App in your Entra ID tenant, please be aware that this will impair our ability to manage ESP profiles and keep blocking apps up-to-date for you.</p>
