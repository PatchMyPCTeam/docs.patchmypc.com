# Delete an App Registration in Entra ID

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

Once you have successfully completed any scenarios (such as [Recover Your Company](../../cloud-administration/manage-your-cloud-company/recover-your-cloud-company.md)) where you had to create an App Registration for use in Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud, you need to delete the App Registration to avoid potential security issues and prevent unwanted re-use.

To delete an App Registration:

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Azure portal using an account with the <strong>GlobalAdmin</strong> role and navigate to the [App Registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) blade.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Important</strong></p>
<p>You must use an account in the same Microsoft 365 subscription (tenant) as your PMPC Company.</p>
</blockquote>
