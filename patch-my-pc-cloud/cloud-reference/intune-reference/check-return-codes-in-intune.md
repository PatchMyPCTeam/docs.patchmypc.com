1. Sign in to the **Intune admin center**.
2.  Navigate to **Apps**.\


    ![](/_images/image-(281 "").png "")


3.  Navigate to **All Apps**.\


    ![](/_images/image-(282 "").png "")


4.  Click the app if itâ€™s shown in the results or search for it.\

    ![](/_images/image-(2542 "").png "")
5.  Navigate to **Manage | Properties**\
    \


    ![](/_images/image-(2543 "").png "")


6.  Scroll down to the **Program** section, under which you will find the **Return codes**.\
