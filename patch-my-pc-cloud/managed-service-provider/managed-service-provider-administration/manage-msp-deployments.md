# Manage MSP Deployments

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

Managed Service Providers (MSPs) can manage deployments in both their own Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud company and any child companies they manage using the standard [Deployments](../../cloud-deployments/) processes.

Users in the child company can also manage deployments in their company, based on the user role they have been assigned.
