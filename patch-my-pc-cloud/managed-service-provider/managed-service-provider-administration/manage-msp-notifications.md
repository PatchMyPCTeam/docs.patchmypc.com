The parent Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud Managed Service Provider (MSP) company will receive all of the various email notification types that are generated by the child companies, including:

* <strong>Users requesting access -</strong> All <strong>Request Access</strong> emails for the child company are sent to any <strong>Full Admin with Access Management</strong> users on both the parent and child companies.
* Update notifications.
* When the email address of any MSP user is added to a notification on a child company.
* <strong>Binary Free Apps â€“</strong> The options available for configuring [Binary Free App update notifications](../../binary-free-apps/manage-new-version-notifications-for-a-binary-free-app.md), depend on whether any user accounts have been created on the child company:
  * If no users have been created on the child company, the <strong>Notify All users in Company</strong> option will be unavailable, as there are no users to notify.
  * If users have been created, then all options will be available.
