# License the Managed Service Provider Feature

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

Once the parent MSP company has been onboarded to Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud, you must configure it to use an MSP Plus license.

**Important**

Once you license a company with an MSP license, you cannot switch that company to a different PMPC Cloud license type.

To configure a company to use an MSP Plus license:

1. Follow the [Manage your License](../cloud-administration/manage-your-environments-in-cloud/manage-your-cloud-license.md) process and enter the MSP Plus license key on the **Enter License Key** field, then click **Activate Now**.
2. Click **Close** on the **You have successfully activated your license** dialog box.\
