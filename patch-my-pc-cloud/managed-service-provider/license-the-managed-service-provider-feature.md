_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

Once the parent MSP company has been onboarded to Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud, you must configure it to use an MSP Plus license.

Once you license a company with an MSP license, you cannot switch that company to a different PMPC Cloud license type.

2. Click **Close** on the **You have successfully activated your license** dialog box.\
