<p>**Note**</p>
<p>You can only delete a Custom App for an MSP from the company where it was created. Deleting a Custom App for an MSP automatically deletes it from any child companies it is shared with.</p>

<p>**Important**</p>
<p>If you try to delete a Custom App for an MSP that is shared with and deployed from a child, you will see the “**Are you sure?**” popup warning you of the impact and prompting you to confirm the deletion of the deployment at the child company.</p>
