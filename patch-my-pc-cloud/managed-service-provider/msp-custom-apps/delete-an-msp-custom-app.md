# Delete an MSP Custom App

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

To delete a Custom App for a Managed Service Provider (MSP) you’ve created in Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud, follow the [Delete a Custom App](../../custom-apps/delete-a-custom-app.md) process for the relevant app.

> **Note**
>
> You can only delete a Custom App for an MSP from the company where it was created. Deleting a Custom App for an MSP automatically deletes it from any child companies it is shared with.

> **Important**
>
> If you try to delete a Custom App for an MSP that is shared with and deployed from a child, you will see the “**Are you sure?**” popup warning you of the impact and prompting you to confirm the deletion of the deployment at the child company.
