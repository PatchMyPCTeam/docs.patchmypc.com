# Create an MSP Custom App

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

To use the Custom Apps for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) feature of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud to create a Custom App:

1. Follow the [Create a Custom App](../../custom-apps/create-a-custom-app/) process to the end of Step 12. (configuring the settings on the **Configurations** page).
2. Configure the **Custom App Visibility** section as required:

* **All Customers –** This Custom App will be visible on all current and any new child companies. Although child companies will see the Custom App in their App Catalog and be able to deploy it, they won’t be able to edit or update the app.\
  \
  • **Specific Customers** – This Custom App will only be visible on the child companies selected from the Customers dropdown on the parent. Although the selected child companies will see the Custom App in their App Catalog and be able to deploy it, they won’t be able to edit or update the app.\
  \
  • **No Customers (default) –** This Custom App will not be visible on any child companies of the parent, just the parent itself.

> \*\*Note\*\*
>
> Using the \*\*Specific Customers\*\* option does not automatically make the Custom App visible on any new child companies. If required, these will need to be manually added.
