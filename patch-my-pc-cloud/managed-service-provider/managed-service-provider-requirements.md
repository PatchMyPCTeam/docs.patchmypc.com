# Managed Service Provider Requirements

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

To use the Managed Service Provider (MSP) feature of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud:

* The parent MSP company needs to be [onboarded to PMPC Cloud](../onboard-to-cloud.md).

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>Once the parent company has been onboarded to PMPC Cloud, it does not need to be connected to an Intune tenant.</p>
<p>The child company to be managed by the MSP company does not need to be onboarded to PMPC Cloud, as the parent company will complete this when it starts managing the child company.</p>
</blockquote>

* The parent MSP company will need to be configured to use an [MSP Plus license](license-the-managed-service-provider-feature.md).
* The MSP onboarding the child company will need the credentials of an account with the Global Administrator role in the child companyâ€™s Intune tenant to be managed.
