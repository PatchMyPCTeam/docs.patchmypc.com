# MSP App Sets

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

The Managed Service Provider (MSP) _Application Sets_ (App Sets) feature is designed to streamline the deployment and management of applications across multiple customers or tenants.

App Sets allow MSPs to create a predefined collection of apps and deploy them simultaneously to multiple customers or tenants. This simplifies the onboarding process for new customers and ensures consistency across various customers/environments. With just a few clicks, you can assign a set of apps to new customers, facilitating a uniform deployment process.

Using the App Sets feature you can:

* [Create an App Set](create-an-msp-app-set.md)
* [Edit an App Set](edit-an-msp-app-set.md)
* [Delete an App Set](delete-an-msp-app-set.md)

> **Note**
>
> To use the App Sets feature, you need to be assigned one of the following PMPC Cloud portal roles:
>
> \* Full Admins (with and without access)
>
> \* Intune Admins.
>
> **Read-Only Admins** can view the App Sets page, but will not be able to make any changes.
>
> **Custom App Admins** cannot view the App Sets page
>
> Also, App Sets are not supported on macOS.
