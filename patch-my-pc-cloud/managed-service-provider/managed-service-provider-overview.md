# Managed Service Provider Overview

_Applies to: Patch My PC Cloud_

The _Managed Service Provider_ (MSP) feature of Patch My PC (PMPC) Cloud allows one company (referred to as the _parent Company_) to manage another companyâ€™s Intune environment (referred to as the &#x63;_&#x68;ild Company_) using PMPC Cloud.

<p>The MSP feature has its own special requirements, as detailed in [Managed Service Provider Requirements](managed-service-provider-requirements.md).</p>

Once an MSP has created a child company in PMPC Cloud, they can create and manage the following:

* [Companies](managed-service-provider-administration/manage-msp-companies/)
* [Users](managed-service-provider-administration/manage-msp-users.md)
* [Deployments](managed-service-provider-administration/manage-msp-deployments.md)
* [Events](managed-service-provider-administration/manage-msp-events.md)
* [Notifications](managed-service-provider-administration/manage-msp-notifications.md)
* [Custom Apps](msp-custom-apps/)
