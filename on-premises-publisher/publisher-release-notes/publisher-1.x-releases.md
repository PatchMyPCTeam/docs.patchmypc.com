  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-961](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-961)

#### Improvements

* Improved the updating of supported products metadata during Publisher synchronization.

#### Fixes

* Adjust certificate signing validation for Patch My PC signed files.
* Fixed an issue where [Recreate Detection](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#RecreateDetection) for MSI-based applications would not populate some variables in the script.

### 1.9.8 - 2020-12-14

#### Features

* Manage categories for Configuration Manager applications
  * User Categories: Viewable to users in Software Center
  * Admin Categories: Viewable to administrators in the Configuration Manager Console
  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-780](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-780)
* ScriptRunner now has a new custom variable, %CurrentDir%
  * This variable may need to be put in double-quotes or the entire parameter may need to be in double quotes depending on the application. Examples of this are below.
    * Config=”%CurrentDir%\Config.ini”
    * “Config=%CurrentDir%\Config.ini”
  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-985](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-985)

#### Improvements

* During a Publisher sync, the Settings.xml will be automatically updated according to SupportProducts. This improves the experiences when Patch My PC makes metadata changes that impact some of the application configurations such as detection.
* The Intune Application Manager now has a button for ‘Manage Assignments’
* Improve how ScriptRunner handles version parts that exceed the 32 bit signed integer max.
* Improve [CVE Import Wizard](https://patchmypc.com/how-the-cve-import-wizard-works-for-matching-cve-ids) CVE-ID matching
* Improve logging associated with delayed application publishing
* The[ SSRS report dashboards](https://patchmypc.com/free-software-update-compliance-dashboard-reports-for-microsoft-sccm) now include a parameter for Deployed.

### 1.9.7 - 2020-11-24

#### Features

* Manage Intune categories for created and updated Intune applications and updates.
  * Note: Currently, existing applications/updates in Intune will not have their categories removed but new categories will be added for existing Win32 applications.
  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I965](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-965)
* Clicking a ‘digest’ in the Modify Published Updates Wizard, or the Package Details wizard will now open the respective VirusTotal page.

#### Improvements

* Sorting by ‘Selected’ in Modify Published Updates Wizard now sorts by the checked state.
* The Configuration Manager detection script now handles invalid version parts better. Some vendors use DateTime stamps in their version. This can end up being a value larger than a 32-bit integer causing the version cast to fail.

#### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where copied Intune Assignments for newly published Intune software would not have their custom available time, and deadline time adjusted relative to the new publish date.
* Fixed an issue where Intune Assignments would be created without a deadline or available time if the ‘copy assignment’ option was not configured.
* Fixed an issue where the maximum value for restart notification would not allow a value greater than 201.

* Improved the speed at which the catalog is extracted for the CVE Import Wizard.
* Win32 Intune applications will no longer be created as featured by default.
  * Existing Intune applications will not have their ‘featured’ state changed. The Publisher will retain the currently configured ‘featured’ setting for any given application.

  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-911](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-911)

#### Improvements

* Log out the in-progress count of updates and applications as they are processed.
  * Previously the in-progress count was only logged if the log level was set to debug. It is now logged with informational level logging.
* Improve the PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exe to have better logic when searching the registry for uninstall strings
* The PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner.exe will retry MSI based operations if a 1618 exit code is returned by the installer. The result is a reduction in failed installs due to Windows Installer being unavailable.

### 1.9.1 - 2020-09-21

#### Features

* Added an option to disable WSUS publishing using a checkbox at the top of the 'Updates' tab. This allows the Update publishing feature to be disabled while still retaining all products and settings. This can be helpful if you need to sync only Applications, Intune Applications, or Intune Updates, but don't want to lose your selected Updates and configurations.
* Added a right-click option to open the help page that details the right-click options.
* During synchronization, the Publisher will check if the WSUS code signing certificate is expired or near expiration and add a message in the email report.
* During synchronization, the Publisher will check if the WSUS code signing certificate is in the required Windows Cert stores and add it if needed.
* SMTP port automatically set to 587 when 'Use TLS' is selected, and to 25 when 'Use TLS' is unselected. The port can still be manually edited to account for any port, but the common port for the protocol is set by default.

#### Improvements

* Add additional known errors in the log, providing a link to a KB article that may assist with solving the known error.
* Display additional info in the Certificate information wizard on whether the certificate is found in the expected Windows Cert stores.
* SMTP port default to 25 instead of 587 when the feature is in a non-configured state.

* Fixed an issue where a machine with a large number of CPU cores may experience high CPU load when running the Intune Scan Wizard.

### 1.9.0 - 2020-09-11

#### Fixes

* Fixed a bug where if the [application delay option](https://patchmypc.com/application-creation-options#topic6) is enabled and an update contains spaces in the file name such as Firefox, it may download with an incorrect file name.
  * This would cause the following error in appenforce.log:
    *   \*\*fails to install error code Looking for exit code

        &#x20; -2147467259 in exit codes table\*\*
    * <strong>Unmatched exit code (2147500037) is considered an execution failure.</strong>&#x20;
